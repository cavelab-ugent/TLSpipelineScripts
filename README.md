HPC:

Input files: riproject preprocessed using Phil's github repo (TODO: link)

Transfer files to HPC: TODO: link to howto

Locate files into one of these folders:
TODO: list folders here, explain scratch, limits and recommend membership of VO etc.




TODO's for first HPC RUN:

- Rewrite and test instance segmentation loop
- Give overview of files not present after semantic segmentation loop that would be expected to detect failed containers
- Test local bind paths, or omit?
